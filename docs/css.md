#CSS Code Style

We are using both Sass pre-processor and PostCSS post-processors.

- Auto-prefixer handles generating vendor prefixes of styling rules when necessary
- css-mqpacker organizes all same media queries into a single query
- csswring minifies the css file with sourcemaps
- pixrem creates pixel fallback for rem values
